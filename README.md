# Conversion

## About Conversion

There are many great conversion app on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I would like to convert my fiber internet up and down connection speed from MBps which I get from [Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/) to Mbps. Additionally, I would like to change the weight, height and reach of [UFC athletes'](https://www.ufc.com/athletes) from pounds/lbs to kilograms/kg and from inch/in to centimeter/cm which is problematic due to the fact that I live in Ethiopia, not the United States, and our measurements differ.
